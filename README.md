# Tasks TODO:

1) Find and implement all TODOs in the project. At the end you should have a working integration with radio API.

2) Replace [com.example.practice.main.Router] with Jetpack Navigation. (optional)

3) Add reoccurring notification which reminds you to come back to application. 
WorkManager and NotificationManager are helpful here.
